Golang for Ruby on Rails developer, tools tips &amp; tricks

## Intro

Nowadays there is no web developer who know only one single language (framework). If you work as `Ruby
on Rails` developer you have all tools right out of the box, and wide list of extensions
from simple `AR` plugins to complete rails engines.

This project aims to eliminate "mental switch" problem what you have when you just start
your `Golang` journey. We hope it will be useful for developers who hit the performance
wall and try to replace some parts of the monolithic app with `golang` based solutions.
